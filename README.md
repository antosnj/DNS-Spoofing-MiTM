# DNS Spoofing with MITM Attack

We have carried out a demonstration of the MITM attack together with the DNS spoofing, starting with a network setup with different experimental devices and the actual attack performance, showing how a fake webpage can be returned to possibly any user connected to a public network, violating the integrity of the legit webpage service.

All using BASH, along with a careful monitoring with Wireshark. We include everything in the report, which we also aim to further develop, improve and complete by the final deliverable. We want to emphasize the role of the report when in terms of how to get a better understanding of what is happening at each step of the process, as well of to interpret results.

The attack has been automatized and BASH files have been created so as to be run in the terminal as super user making the attack much more autonomous and automatic.

Also, we have included information on how to deffend an attack of DNS spoofing.
